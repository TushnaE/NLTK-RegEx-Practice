* NLTK: `nltkbasics.py`
* RegEx: `regular_expressions.py`
* Markdown: `README.md`

# Markdown
**Tutorial: <https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/>**

*This is my first time creating a markdown document from scratch! To see a preview of the MD document, in VSCode command+shit+v shows a preview. Here are some more notes:*


## Emphasis

Italics: wrap text in single asterisks (*) or single underscores (_) 

Bold: wrap text in double asterisks (**) or double underscores (__)

## Headings

Headings are characterized by the hashtag symbol (#) and are activated
when there is a space between the hashtag(s) and the text it is meant to
create a heading out of

The more '#' the smaller the header


## Paragraphs

Can either dictate a paragraph with a \ at the end of a line
or with an empty line break which is characterized by a line
that is made up of spaces, tab characters, or a new line character (enter)


## Block Quote

Start a block quote with '<'


## Lists
Use any of *, + or - to make a list. Each list must consistently use the same character. The list character requires a space after it

Ordered lists start with a number followed by a . or ) and a space. The numbers can start wherever, not necessarily at the number 1, but will start at the first number in the list specified

To nest one list within another, indent each item in the sublist by four spaces. You can also nest other elements like paragraphs, blockquotes or code blocks.

## Links

URLs may not become links in Markdown until enclosed in < and >. Turn this URL into a link:


Link text is enclosed by square brackets [], and for inline links, the link URL is enclosed by parens () directly after the [link text].

## Images

Images are almost identical to links, but an image starts with an exclamation point !.

`![](url goes here)~`

## Inline Code

Wrap inline code with backticks ` and code chunks with three ```
